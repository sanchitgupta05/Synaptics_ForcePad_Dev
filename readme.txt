Hi,

This project " Synaptics ForcePad Music Generator" has files and code for using the new synaptics force pad as a music generator (sort of a piano). This project was initiated and completed at HackMIT on October 5, 2013 (also my birthday).

 - We use the x, y, and z axis of the ForcePad and convert it to different piano notes.
 - The ForcePad gives input to the PC through interupts. These interrupts are captured by the program which then manipulate the information of the position of the fingers (plural) on the pad. These positions are then converted to the different musical notes.
 - The Code is in C++
